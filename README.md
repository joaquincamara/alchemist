Alchemist.go it's a command cli powered by Go, it's commands allow you to transmute projects with React.js for the client app and Go for the backend api.

### Commands

To invoque any of the ancestral spells of our book of Alchemy we need to use the special word "alchemist" at the terminal, This gonna open the door to the world of alchemy and bring all the resources to transmute a new alchemist's project.

- **\$alchemist transmute** : this command is going to start the transmutation of a new alchemist's project, with a React.js app and a base go server.

**NOTE:** At the 0.1.0 version the transmute command is just able to setup the neccesary files to duplicate a "create react app" base project. You need to run "Yarn" or "npm install" to install the dev dependencies and run the React.js project
